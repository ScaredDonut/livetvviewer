## Live TV Channel Viewer

This simple script displays live TV channels from around the world. (Streamed by other people). All it does is pulls the info from streamlive.tv via their XML.

## Installation

Simply upload the index.php to any compatiable host, and you're ready to go!

## Why use this, when I can go on streamlive.tv

There are no real beneifits to using this, I made this simple script back in 2013 when I had my own "Watch free movies online" website. So it was useful back then. Other than that, you'd probably be better off using steamlive.tv
